# Session TODOs - Remaining Tasks

## ðŸ”´ CRITICAL - Next Session Blockers

### 1. ISO Specification Acquisition
- [ ] **Purchase ISO/IEC 21122-1:2024** (Core coding system)
  - **Source**: ISO official store or ANSI webstore  
  - **Cost**: ~$110
  - **Priority**: Highest - blocks all clean-room development
  - **Status**: REQUIRED before any implementation work

## ðŸŸ¡ HIGH PRIORITY - Ready to Start

### 2. Clean-Room Development Structure Setup
- [ ] Create `commercial/jpegxs-core-clean` crate structure
- [ ] Establish clean-room development guidelines
- [ ] Document allowed vs forbidden sources
- [ ] Create development log template
- [ ] Set up legal compliance tracking

### 3. JPEG XS Bitstream Format Implementation  
- [ ] Study publicly available JPEG XS format information
- [ ] Implement SOC (Start of Codestream) marker (0xFF10)
- [ ] Add basic SIZ (Image Size) marker (0xFF50)
- [ ] Create minimal packet structure
- [ ] **Goal**: File starts with proper JPEG XS markers

### 4. Current Output Analysis and Mapping
- [ ] Analyze the 512KB raw coefficient structure
- [ ] Map quantized data to JPEG XS packet format
- [ ] Identify specific entropy coding requirements  
- [ ] Document data flow from DWT â†’ quantization â†’ expected bitstream
- [ ] Create bridge plan to proper JPEG XS format

## ðŸŸ¢ MEDIUM PRIORITY - Post-ISO Spec

### 5. Clean-Room DWT Implementation
- [ ] Study ISO Section 7.3 mathematical equations
- [ ] Implement 5/3 DWT from mathematical specification only
- [ ] Replace derivative DWT code with clean-room version
- [ ] Validate DWT properties (without reference comparison)
- [ ] Document all mathematical sources used

### 6. Entropy Coding Foundation
- [ ] Study ISO Section 8 entropy coding specifications  
- [ ] Implement VLC (Variable Length Coding) tables
- [ ] Add significance propagation coding passes
- [ ] Implement refinement coding passes
- [ ] Create bit packing and stream generation

### 7. Format Compliance and Validation
- [ ] Implement remaining JPEG XS markers (COD, PIH, PIV, EPH)
- [ ] Add proper packet header structure
- [ ] Implement precinct organization
- [ ] Achieve full format compliance
- [ ] Validate against reference decoder

## âšª LOW PRIORITY - Future Sessions

### 8. Performance Optimization
- [ ] Profile current implementation performance
- [ ] Add SIMD optimizations for DWT
- [ ] Optimize memory usage patterns
- [ ] Add multi-threading support
- [ ] Benchmark against reference implementation

### 9. Extended Features and Profiles
- [ ] Implement Main 4:2:2 profile compliance
- [ ] Add Main 4:4:4 profile support  
- [ ] Implement additional pixel formats
- [ ] Add streaming and progressive support
- [ ] Error resilience features

### 10. Commercial Licensing Preparation
- [ ] Complete legal review of all components
- [ ] Prepare licensing documentation
- [ ] Create technical support infrastructure
- [ ] Develop customer onboarding materials
- [ ] Establish pricing and contract templates

## ðŸ“Š PROGRESS TRACKING

### Current Baseline (2025-09-06)
- **File Size**: 512KB (Rust) vs 24KB (Reference) = 21.3x larger
- **Format Compliance**: 0% - No JPEG XS markers present
- **Compression Ratio**: 0.2:1 vs 5.3:1 reference
- **Critical Gaps**: Bitstream format, entropy coding

### Success Metrics Targets

#### Short-term (2-4 weeks)
- [ ] File size < 100KB (50% reduction)
- [ ] SOC marker present (basic compliance)
- [ ] Compression ratio > 1:1 (actual compression)

#### Medium-term (1-2 months)  
- [ ] File size < 50KB (approach reference)
- [ ] Multiple JPEG XS markers present
- [ ] Compression ratio > 2:1

#### Long-term (2-3 months)
- [ ] File size â‰ˆ 24KB (reference parity)
- [ ] Full JPEG XS format compliance
- [ ] Compression ratio â‰ˆ 5:1 (reference parity)
- [ ] Commercial licensing ready

## ðŸ”„ NEXT SESSION WORKFLOW

### Session Startup (10 minutes)
1. Environment check and git pull
2. Run validation baseline
3. Review current status
4. Confirm ISO spec availability

### Primary Work (80% of session)
5. ISO specification study (if available)
6. Begin highest priority implementation
7. Use validation framework to measure progress
8. Document all sources and decisions

### Session Wrap-up (10 minutes)  
9. Run full validation suite
10. Update progress documentation
11. Commit and push changes
