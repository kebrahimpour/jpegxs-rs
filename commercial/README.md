# Commercial Track - Clean-Room Implementation

## ⚠️ CRITICAL LEGAL NOTICE

This directory contains clean-room implementations developed ONLY from:
- ISO/IEC 21122 specifications
- Academic papers and textbooks
- Mathematical equations and algorithms

**ABSOLUTELY NO CODE from the reference implementation or evaluation track may be copied, referenced, or studied when working in this commercial track.**

## Clean-Room Development Rules

### ✅ ALLOWED Resources
- ISO/IEC 21122-1:2019 (Core coding system)
- ISO/IEC 21122-2:2019 (Profiles and buffer models)
- Academic papers on wavelet transforms
- Mathematical specifications

### ❌ FORBIDDEN Resources
- Any code in `reference/jxs/` directory
- Any code in `crates/` directory (except I/O utilities marked as original)
- GitHub repositories with JPEG XS implementations
- AI-generated code suggestions for specific algorithms

## Current Status

The commercial track is ready for clean-room development. Next step: obtain ISO specifications and begin DWT implementation from mathematical equations only.

## Success Criteria

- [ ] All algorithms implemented from ISO spec only
- [ ] Zero derivative code in commercial track
- [ ] Performance within 20% of reference implementation
