# Commercial Track - Clean Room Implementation

## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: CLEAN ROOM REQUIREMENTS

This directory contains ONLY clean-room implementations with full commercial rights.

### Rules for Contributing to This Directory

1. **NEVER** copy code from `reference/` directory
2. **NEVER** look at reference implementation while coding here
3. **ONLY** use these resources:
   - ISO/IEC 21122 standard documents
   - Academic papers and textbooks
   - Mathematical definitions
   - Your own original ideas

### Current Status

#### ‚úÖ Ready for Commercial Use
- Project structure and build system
- CLI interface design
- I/O utilities (non-algorithmic)
- Testing framework

#### üöß In Development (Clean Room)
- [ ] DWT 5/3 transform (from ISO spec)
- [ ] DWT 9/7 transform (from ISO spec)
- [ ] Entropy coding (from ISO spec)
- [ ] Packet structure (from ISO spec)

#### üìã Planned
- [ ] Rate control algorithms
- [ ] Profile implementations
- [ ] SIMD optimizations

### How This Works

1. **Study Phase**: Read ONLY specifications and papers
2. **Design Phase**: Create original design documents
3. **Implement Phase**: Write code from scratch
4. **Test Phase**: Validate against spec requirements
5. **Review Phase**: Legal review for clean-room compliance

### Commercial Licensing

Code in this directory can be:
- Licensed commercially without restrictions
- Sold as proprietary software
- Used in closed-source products
- Distributed under any license terms
