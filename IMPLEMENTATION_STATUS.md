# JPEG XS Implementation Status Report

## Current Status

### ✅ Working Components

1. **Build System & CI/CD**
   - Rust workspace with 4 crates architecture
   - All tests passing (5/5)
   - GitHub Actions CI passing on all platforms
   - Clean clippy and formatting

2. **I/O Infrastructure**
   - YUV 4:2:2 and 4:4:4 file loading/saving
   - Bit-level I/O operations  
   - CLI framework with proper argument parsing

3. **Core Processing Components**
   - DWT 5/3 transforms (forward/inverse) - **DERIVATIVE CODE**
   - Basic quantization/dequantization
   - Floating point processing pipeline

4. **Reference Implementation**
   - Built and functional on macOS
   - Produces standards-compliant JPEG XS bitstreams
   - Can be used for validation and test vector generation

### ❌ Missing Critical Components

#### 1. **JPEG XS Bitstream Format**
- **Current**: Outputs raw float data (524KB for 256x256 image)
- **Expected**: JPEG XS standard bitstream with markers (24KB for same image)
- **Issue**: Missing entropy coding, packet structure, markers

#### 2. **Standards Compliance**
- No SOC (Start of Codestream) marker (FF 10)
- No SIZ (Image Size) marker (FF 50) 
- No COD (Coding Style Default) marker (FF 52)
- No packet headers or precinct structure

#### 3. **Entropy Coding**
- Current implementation bypasses entropy coding entirely
- Just dumps quantized coefficients as raw bytes
- Missing VLC tables, significance propagation, refinement passes

## Size Comparison Analysis

| Implementation | File Size | Compression Ratio | Format |
|---------------|-----------|------------------|---------|
| Reference (C) | 24 KB | 22:1 | JPEG XS Standard |
| Rust Current | 512 KB | 1:1 | Raw Float Dump |
| Input YUV | 128 KB | - | YUV 4:2:2 Planar |

**The Rust implementation is currently 21x larger than the reference!**

## Architecture Assessment

### Derivative vs Original Code Status

| Component | Status | Commercial Use |
|-----------|---------|---------------|
| YUV I/O | ✅ Original | ✅ Can commercialize |
| Bit I/O | ✅ Original | ✅ Can commercialize |
| CLI Tools | ✅ Original | ✅ Can commercialize |
| DWT 5/3 | ❌ Derivative | ❌ Cannot commercialize |
| Quantization | ✅ Original | ✅ Can commercialize |
| Entropy Coding | ❌ Missing | N/A |
| Bitstream Format | ❌ Missing | N/A |

## Development Priorities

### Immediate (Week 1-2)
1. **Clean-Room DWT Implementation**
   - Study ISO/IEC 21122-1:2019 Section 7.3
   - Reimplement from mathematical specification only
   - No reference to current derivative code

2. **Basic Bitstream Structure** 
   - Implement SOC, SIZ, COD markers
   - Create proper packet headers
   - Basic precinct structure

### Medium Term (Week 3-4)  
3. **Entropy Coding**
   - VLC tables from ISO specification
   - Significance and refinement coding
   - Proper bit packing

4. **Profile Compliance**
   - Main 4:2:2 profile implementation
   - Level constraints and validation

### Long Term (Week 5+)
5. **Performance Optimization**
6. **Extended Profile Support**
7. **Advanced Features**

## Commercial Track Setup Needed

The current codebase has derivative components that prevent commercial licensing. Need to establish:

1. **`commercial/` directory structure**
2. **Clean-room development process**  
3. **ISO specification access**
4. **Legal compliance documentation**

## Recommendations

1. **Do NOT continue development in current `crates/` directory** for commercial features
2. **Start clean-room implementation** in `commercial/` track immediately  
3. **Use current implementation** only for:
   - Testing and validation against reference
   - Understanding the problem domain
   - Generating test vectors

The current Rust implementation is a good proof-of-concept but needs complete rewrite of core algorithms for commercial use.
