# JPEG-XS Quality Improvement - Phase 2 Plan
## Coefficient Range Extension for Production Quality

### üéØ Mission Statement
Achieve >30 dB PSNR and >90% conformance compliance by extending coefficient range handling in entropy coding system.

---

## üìä Current Status (Phase 1 Complete)

### ‚úÖ Major Achievements
- **DWT**: Perfect reconstruction (0.000 error, infinite PSNR)
- **Entropy Coding**: Error rate reduced from 24.3% to 16.2%
- **Pipeline Quality**: Improved from 9.88 to 10.26 dB PSNR
- **Test Infrastructure**: Comprehensive validation suite

### ‚ùå Remaining Bottleneck
**Coefficient Range Limitation**: Large coefficients (>127) clamped to ¬±127
- **Impact**: 128-unit loss per coefficient (e.g., 255 ‚Üí 127)
- **Error Rate**: 16.2% of coefficients still have precision loss
- **Quality Gap**: ~20 dB PSNR improvement potential

## üöÄ Phase 2 Implementation Plan

### Priority 1: Extend Coefficient Storage (Week 1-2)

#### 1.1 Analysis and Design (2 days)
- **Coefficient Range Analysis**
  - Analyze typical coefficient distributions in test images
  - Determine optimal bit depth (8-bit vs 16-bit vs variable)
  - Design backward-compatible bitstream format

#### 1.2 8-Bit Coefficient Extension (3 days)
- **Extend entropy storage to 8-bit signed (-128 to +127)**
- **Update encoding logic**:
  ```rust
  // Current: 7-bit clamping
  let clamped = abs_coeff.min(127) as u8;

  // Target: 8-bit full range
  let full_range = abs_coeff.min(255) as u8;
  ```
- **Update decoder logic** to handle 8-bit coefficients
- **Maintain backward compatibility** with existing bitstreams

#### 1.3 Quality Validation (2 days)
- **Target**: Achieve >25 dB PSNR on gradient tests
- **Validate**: No regression in small/medium coefficient handling
- **Test**: Full conformance suite improvement

### Priority 2: Advanced Coefficient Encoding (Week 3)

#### 2.1 Dynamic Range Optimization
- **Smart bit allocation** based on coefficient distribution
- **Huffman-style encoding** for common coefficient values
- **Range prediction** to minimize storage overhead

#### 2.2 Subband-Aware Quantization
- **Different QP per DWT subband** (currently uniform QP=1)
- **Perceptual weighting** (lower QP for low-frequency subbands)
- **Quality-adaptive** coefficient precision

### Priority 3: Production Optimization (Week 4)

#### 3.1 Performance Optimization
- **Vectorized coefficient processing**
- **Memory layout optimization**
- **Compression ratio improvement**

#### 3.2 Quality Assurance
- **Target**: >90% conformance compliance
- **Target**: >30 dB PSNR for quality 0.9
- **Comprehensive edge case testing**
