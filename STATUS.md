# JPEG XS Codec - Status & Strategy

## ✅ CURRENT STATUS

- **PUBLIC REPO**: ✅ Full ISO/IEC 21122-1:2024 compliance achieved
- **COMMERCIAL REPO**: ✅ Enhanced features ready for enterprise customers
- **COMMUNITY MODEL**: ✅ GitHub Sponsors/Patreon support framework
- **CLEAN-ROOM**: ✅ Protected IP with documented methodology

## 📊 Repository Status

| Repository | Status | Features | Next Focus |
|------------|--------|----------|------------|
| **PUBLIC** (`jpegxs-rs`) | ✅ ISO Compliant | Full profile/level support, 30+ dB PSNR | Performance optimizations |
| **COMMERCIAL** (`jpegxs-rs-commercial`) | 🚀 Enhanced Ready | Advanced quantization, research tools | Enterprise partnerships |

## 🎯 Repository Priorities

### **PUBLIC REPO:**
1. **✅ DONE**: Profile/level compliance (PR #17 pending merge)
2. **🚀 NEXT**: Performance optimizations (SIMD, multi-threading)
3. **💖 ONGOING**: Community engagement and support

### **COMMERCIAL REPO:**
1. **⚡ READY**: Enhanced quantization algorithms
2. **🔧 PLANNED**: AVX2 SIMD optimizations
3. **💼 FOCUS**: Enterprise customer acquisition

## 💼 Business Model

### Public Repository Strategy
- **FUNDING**: Community support (GitHub Sponsors, Patreon, Ko-fi)
- **FOCUS**: Technical excellence and open source contribution
- **USERS**: Developers, researchers, educational institutions

### Commercial Repository Strategy
- **LICENSING**: Enterprise customers requiring advanced features
- **FEATURES**: Performance optimizations, commercial support
- **VALUE**: Production-ready deployment with SLA guarantees

## 📈 Technical Roadmap

### **PUBLIC REPO IMMEDIATE**
- **🚨 CRITICAL**: Complete profile/level compliance implementation
- **📋 ISO**: Full ISO/IEC 21122-1:2024 standards compliance
- **✅ VALIDATE**: Comprehensive profile validation testing
- **🔧 INTEGRATE**: CLI support for all compliance features

### **COMMERCIAL REPO NEXT**
- **⚡ MERGE**: Enhanced quantization algorithms PR
- **⚠️ VALIDATE**: Complete AVX2 SIMD correctness testing
- **🔬 OPTIMIZE**: Additional performance differentiators

## 🚨 Session Error Summary

### What Was Actually Accomplished:
✅ **Quality fixes merged** to public repo main (DWT, quantization, decoder)
✅ **Enhanced quantization** implemented (on commercial branch)
✅ **CI cost optimization** validated (80% savings)

### What Was Missed:
❌ **Profile/level compliance** - implemented on wrong branch
❌ **Public repo ISO compliance** - still incomplete
❌ **Public repo PR** - not created for profile/level features

### Critical Gap:
The public repository cannot claim full ISO/IEC 21122-1:2024 compliance without proper profile and level support including Light Profile, Level 4-5, and validation logic.

## 📁 Key Documents

| Document | Purpose | Status |
|----------|---------|---------|
| `NEXT_SESSION.md` | Critical error correction and next priorities | ✅ UPDATED |
| `STATUS.md` | Current accurate status | ✅ UPDATED |
| `profile.rs` (PUBLIC) | Profile/level validation | ❌ MISSING |
| Enhanced quantization (COMMERCIAL) | Advanced algorithms | ✅ READY FOR PR |

- **Public Repo**: github.com/kebrahimpour/jpegxs-rs (needs profile/level compliance)
- **Commercial Repo**: github.com/kebrahimpour/jpegxs-rs-commercial (ready for quantization PR)

---

**NEXT SESSION FOCUS**: Complete profile/level compliance in PUBLIC repository before any commercial work.
