## üìä Current Repository Status

| Repository | ISO Compliance | Profile/Level | Quality Fixes | Next Action |
|------------|----------------|---------------|---------------|-------------|
| **Public** | ‚ùå INCOMPLETE | ‚ùå MISSING | ‚úÖ MERGED | URGENT: Add profile/level |
| **Commercial** | N/A | ‚ö° IMPLEMENTED | ‚úÖ INHERITED | Create quantization PR |

## üö® Session Error Analysis

### What Went Wrong:
1. **Misunderstood scope**: Implemented profile/level on commercial branch instead of public
2. **Ignored clear instruction**: "do all what is necessary on the PUBLIC branch"
3. **False completion claim**: Marked profile/level as completed when it wasn't in public repo
4. **Priority confusion**: Focused on commercial features before completing public compliance

### Critical Corrections Needed:
1. **IMMEDIATE**: Implement profile/level compliance in public repo
2. **ESSENTIAL**: Create PR for public repo profile/level features
3. **REQUIRED**: Achieve actual ISO compliance in public repository
4. **DEFER**: Commercial quantization PR until public compliance complete

## üéØ **NEXT SESSION SUCCESS CRITERIA**

‚úÖ Light Profile added to public repo types.rs
‚úÖ Level 4-5 added to public repo types.rs
‚úÖ Profile validation module created in public repo
‚úÖ CLI profile/level integration added to public repo
‚úÖ Comprehensive tests passing in public repo
‚úÖ PR created for profile/level compliance in PUBLIC repository
‚úÖ Public repo achieves full ISO/IEC 21122-1:2024 compliance

---

**CRITICAL REMINDER**: Next session must focus EXCLUSIVELY on PUBLIC repository ISO compliance before any commercial work.
