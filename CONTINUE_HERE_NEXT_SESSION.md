```
Status: ‚úÖ ENHANCED FEATURES PRESERVED, NEEDS BRANCH CLEANUP
Features: 8-bit optimizations + research tools + enterprise support
Licensing: Full commercial edition with premium features
CI Optimization: 70-80% cost reduction operational
```

---

## ‚öñÔ∏è **CRITICAL LEGAL FRAMEWORK - MEMORIZED**

### **üîí Clean-Room Implementation Protection**
```
ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENTS - NEVER MODIFY WITHOUT APPROVAL:
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ commercial/jpegxs-core-clean/src/dwt.rs        # Clean-room DWT (legal evidence)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ commercial/jpegxs-core-clean/src/lib.rs        # Clean-room codec core
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ commercial/README.md                           # Clean-room documentation
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ COMMERCIALIZATION_MEMO.md                     # Legal framework (NEW)
```

**Legal Protection Status:**
- ‚úÖ **Header Documentation**: Contains ISO specification references ONLY
- ‚úÖ **No Derivative Code**: All implementations from published ISO equations
- ‚úÖ **Mathematical Basis**: Documented development from standard only
- ‚úÖ **Evidence Trail**: Clean-room process preserved in both repositories

### **üõ°Ô∏è Patent Landscape Management**
```
MANDATORY PATENT DISCLAIMER (Always Include):
"This software implements the JPEG XS standard (ISO/IEC 21122), which may be
covered by patents. Commercial users are responsible for ensuring they have
appropriate patent licenses from the JPEG XS patent pool (Vectis IP)."
```

**Our Legal Position:**
- **We Provide**: Software implementation of published standard
- **Users Handle**: Patent licensing from essential patent holders
- **Our Liability**: Limited to software defects, NOT patent disputes
- **Documentation**: Always direct users to https://www.vectis-ip.com/

---

## üî¨ **RESEARCH FEATURES ARCHITECTURE - MEMORIZED**

### **ISO Compliance vs Research Extensions**

#### **Public Repository Rules (STRICT)**
```rust
// ONLY ISO-COMPLIANT IMPLEMENTATIONS ALLOWED
pub fn add_entropy_coded_data(&mut self, coefficients: &[i32]) {
    // Standard ISO entropy coding
    // NO experimental features
    // NO bypass modes
}
```

#### **Private Repository Capabilities**
```rust
// RESEARCH EXTENSIONS ALLOWED
JPEGXS_BYPASS_ENTROPY=1    // Algorithm analysis (violates standard)
JPEGXS_DEBUG_COEFFS=1      // Detailed coefficient logging
8-bit coefficient pipeline  // 50% memory reduction
Extended run-length encoding // Enhanced compression research
```

**Why Separation is Critical:**
1. **Legal Safety**: Public repo follows standard exactly (legal protection)
2. **Commercial Value**: Enhanced features justify premium licensing
3. **Research Freedom**: Private repo enables standards-violating research
4. **Compliance**: Clear separation of ISO-compliant vs proprietary features
