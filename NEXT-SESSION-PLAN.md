# Next Session Development Plan

## üî¥ CRITICAL FIRST TASK

### ISO Specification Acquisition
- **Purchase**: ISO/IEC 21122-1:2024 (Core coding system) - ~$110
- **Source**: https://www.iso.org/store.html or ANSI webstore
- **Priority**: Highest - blocks all clean-room development

## üìã SESSION STARTUP CHECKLIST

### Environment Verification (5 minutes)
```bash
cd /Users/keyvan/Work/Projects/sandbox/jpeg-xs
git pull && git status
source "$HOME/.cargo/env"
cargo test --all-features  # Should show 5/5 tests passing
```

### Current Status Check (5 minutes)
```bash
# Review validation baseline
cat VALIDATION_BASELINE.md
python3 tools/validate_output.py test-data/test_256x256_ref.jxs test-data/test_256x256_rust.jxs

# Current gap: 21.3x larger file, zero JPEG XS compliance
```

## üéØ PRIMARY DEVELOPMENT TRACK

### Phase 1: ISO Specification Study (Week 1)
**Prerequisites**: ISO/IEC 21122-1:2024 acquired

1. **Study Section 6**: Bitstream syntax and markers
   - SOC (Start of Codestream) marker structure
   - SIZ (Image Size) marker parameters
   - COD (Coding Style Default) marker format
   - Packet header organization

2. **Study Section 7.3**: DWT mathematical specifications
   - 5/3 reversible DWT equations
   - Forward and inverse transform mathematics
   - Implementation requirements for clean-room development

3. **Study Section 8**: Entropy coding specifications
   - VLC (Variable Length Coding) tables
   - Significance propagation passes
   - Refinement coding passes
   - Bit packing requirements

### Phase 2: Clean-Room Implementation (Week 1-2)
**Location**: `commercial/` directory (avoid contamination)

```bash
cd commercial/
cargo init --lib jpegxs-core-clean
# Document: ALL sources must be ISO specifications only
# NO reference to existing crates/ or reference/ code
```

**Implementation Priority**:
1. **JPEG XS Bitstream Format**
   - SOC marker (0xFF10) implementation
   - Basic packet structure
   - File format compliance

2. **Clean-Room DWT**
   - Mathematical implementation from ISO equations
   - Replace derivative code in current implementation
   - Document all sources used

## üîß VALIDATION-DRIVEN DEVELOPMENT

### Success Metrics Framework
Track progress using established validation tools:

```bash
# After each implementation milestone
python3 tools/test_runner.py
python3 tools/progress_tracker.py
```

**Target Improvements**:
- **Week 1**: File size reduction from 512KB toward 100KB
- **Week 2**: SOC marker present, basic JPEG XS compliance  
- **Week 3**: File size under 50KB with entropy coding
- **Month 1**: Parity with 24KB reference output

### Development Workflow
1. **Make changes** in clean-room environment
2. **Build and test** with validation framework
3. **Measure progress** against baseline metrics
4. **Document sources** used (ISO sections only)
5. **Iterate** based on gap analysis

## üö® STRICT CLEAN-ROOM RULES

### ‚úÖ ALLOWED SOURCES
- ISO/IEC 21122 specifications (all parts)
- Academic papers on JPEG XS mathematics
- Public domain mathematical equations
- Original algorithm implementations

### ‚ùå FORBIDDEN SOURCES  
- Any code in `crates/` or `reference/` directories
- GitHub repositories with JPEG XS implementations
- Stack Overflow or AI-generated code suggestions
- Derivative implementations from other projects

### üìù DOCUMENTATION REQUIREMENTS
- Document every ISO section referenced
- Log all mathematical equations used
- Track implementation decisions
- Maintain clean-room development log

# Detailed gap analysis  
python3 tools/validate_output.py test-data/test_256x256_ref.jxs test-data/test_current.jxs
```
