# Clean Room Implementation Log

## Purpose
This log documents the clean-room implementation process for legal protection and verification that no derivative code was used.

## Format
Each entry should include:
- Date
- Component being implemented
- Resources consulted (must be public/standard documents)
- Developer notes
- Time spent

## Certification

By contributing to the commercial track, I certify that:
1. I have not viewed the reference implementation while working on this code
2. All code is original or derived from public specifications
3. I understand the legal importance of clean-room implementation
4. I will document all resources used
