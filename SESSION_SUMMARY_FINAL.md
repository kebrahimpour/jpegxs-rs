- 💼 **Enterprise Support**: Technical support + custom integration
- ⚡ **Performance Optimizations**: Multi-threading, SIMD acceleration
- 🎯 **Advanced Features**: Custom quantization, lossless modes

## ⚖️ LEGAL & COMPLIANCE FRAMEWORK

### **Clean-Room Implementation Protection**

#### **Critical Legal Assets**
```
Location: commercial/jpegxs-core-clean/
Purpose: Legal protection for commercialization
Evidence: Clean-room development from ISO specification only
```

**Clean-Room Markers:**
- ✅ Header documentation citing ISO/IEC 21122-1:2024 specification only
- ✅ Mathematical equations implemented from standard
- ✅ NO derivative code from reference implementations
- ✅ Preserved in both repositories for legal evidence

**Developer Attestation:**
```
// Clean-room 5/3 DWT implementation from ISO/IEC 21122-1:2024 specification
// Mathematical equations implemented from ISO specification ONLY - NO derivative code used
// Developer: Clean-room implementation
// Date: September 2025
// Legal status: Original work based solely on ISO/IEC 21122-1:2024 mathematical equations
```

### **Patent Landscape & Licensing**

#### **JPEG XS Patent Considerations**
- **Patent Pool**: Managed by Vectis IP (https://www.vectis-ip.com/)
- **User Responsibility**: Commercial users must obtain separate patent licenses
- **Our Position**: We provide codec implementation, users handle patent licensing
- **Documentation**: Patent notice included in commercial documentation

#### **Liability Limitation**
```
IMPORTANT PATENT NOTICE: This software implements the JPEG XS standard (ISO/IEC 21122),
which may be covered by patents. Users are responsible for ensuring they have appropriate
patent licenses for their use case.
```

### **Export Control & Compliance**
- **No Export Restrictions**: Standard cryptographic exclusions apply
- **International Use**: Licensed for worldwide deployment
- **Compliance Documentation**: Provided with commercial licenses

## 🔬 RESEARCH FEATURES ARCHITECTURE

### **ISO Compliance vs Research Extensions**

#### **Public Repository (ISO Compliant Only)**
```rust
// Standard ISO entropy coding only
pub fn add_entropy_coded_data(&mut self, coefficients: &[i32]) {
    // ISO-compliant implementation
    // NO experimental features
}
```

#### **Private Repository (Research Extensions)**
```rust
// Enhanced with research capabilities
JPEGXS_BYPASS_ENTROPY=1  // Algorithm analysis mode
JPEGXS_DEBUG_COEFFS=1    // Detailed coefficient logging
```

**Research Applications:**
- Algorithm validation and verification
- Quality metric development
- Codec comparison studies
- Academic research on wavelet compression

### **Why Separation is Critical**
1. **ISO Compliance**: Public repo follows standard exactly
2. **Commercial Value**: Enhanced features justify commercial licensing
3. **Legal Protection**: Clean separation of standard vs proprietary
4. **Research Freedom**: Private repo enables standards-violating research

## 💰 COMMERCIAL LICENSING FRAMEWORK

### **Revenue Streams**

#### **Community Edition Licensing**
