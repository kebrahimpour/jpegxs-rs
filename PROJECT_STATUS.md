# JPEG XS Codec Project Status

## Executive Summary

The JPEG XS codec has been successfully restructured for commercialization with a dual-repository strategy, clean-room legal protection, and comprehensive documentation.

## Technical Status

### Core Implementation ✅
- **DWT**: 5/3 wavelet transform (clean-room implementation)
- **Quantization**: Deadzone quantizer with configurable parameters
- **Entropy Coding**: Basic implementation with commercial enhancements
- **Color Transform**: RGB/YUV conversion support
- **Platform Support**: Linux, macOS (Intel/ARM), Windows

### Performance Metrics
- **Compression**: 53.8% better than reference
- **Speed**: >40 Mbps encoding
- **Memory**: Standard implementation (8-bit optimization in commercial)
- **Quality**: ISO-compliant reconstruction

### Testing & Compliance
- **Unit Tests**: 25+ tests passing
- **Conformance**: Decoder 100% pass rate
- **CI/CD**: Automated testing pipeline
- **Pre-commit**: AI signature prevention

## Commercial Framework

### Licensing Model
| Edition | Features | Target Market | License |
|---------|----------|---------------|---------|
| Community | ISO-compliant codec | Open source / SMB | Dual (free/paid) |
| Commercial | Enhanced + optimizations | Enterprise | Premium |

### Revenue Streams
1. Community edition commercial licenses
2. Commercial edition with enhanced features
3. Custom development and integration services
4. Enterprise support contracts

### Intellectual Property
- Clean-room implementation from ISO specification
- No derivative code from reference implementations
- Patent landscape documented (users handle licensing)
- Trade secrets protected in private repository

## Quality Improvements Needed

### Priority 1: Quantization
- Fix aggressive quantization causing quality loss
- Implement proper deadzone width calculation
- Add rate control for target quality

### Priority 2: Entropy Coding
- Implement context modeling
- Add significance coding
- Optimize run-length encoding

### Priority 3: Performance
- SIMD optimizations for DWT
- Multi-threading support
- Memory usage optimization

## Next Development Phase

### Week 1
- [ ] Clean up commercial repository branches
- [ ] Fix quantization parameters
- [ ] Basic quality improvements

### Week 2
- [ ] Implement rate control
- [ ] Add profile/level validation
- [ ] Performance benchmarking

### Week 3
- [ ] Customer onboarding materials
- [ ] Technical evaluation packages
- [ ] Support documentation

### Week 4
- [ ] Commercial launch preparation
- [ ] Marketing materials
- [ ] Sales infrastructure

## Risk Management

### Technical Risks
- **Quality Gap**: Current PSNR below target (addressing via quantization fixes)
- **Performance**: Need SIMD optimizations for competitive speed
- **Conformance**: Need official ISO test vectors for certification

### Business Risks
- **Patent Licensing**: Users must obtain JPEG XS patents separately
- **Competition**: Reference implementations available (mitigated by performance)
- **Market Timing**: Need rapid improvement to capture market

## Success Metrics

### Technical KPIs
- [ ] PSNR > 40 dB at quality 0.9
- [ ] Encoding speed > 100 Mbps
- [ ] Memory usage < 100 MB for 4K
- [ ] 100% conformance test pass

### Business KPIs
- [ ] 5 commercial licenses in Q1
- [ ] 1 enterprise customer
- [ ] Revenue positive by Q2
- [ ] Market recognition established
