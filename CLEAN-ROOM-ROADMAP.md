# Clean-Room Implementation Roadmap

## Objective
Replace all derivative code with clean-room implementations to achieve full commercial licensing rights.

## Resources for Clean Implementation
- **Primary**: ISO/IEC 21122-1:2019 (JPEG XS Part 1: Core coding system)
- **Secondary**: ISO/IEC 21122-2:2019 (JPEG XS Part 2: Profiles and buffer models)
- **Academic Papers**: Published research on wavelet transforms and entropy coding
- **NOT ALLOWED**: Reference implementation source code

## Implementation Phases

## Development Guidelines

### For Each Component:

1. **Research Phase**
   ```
   - Read relevant ISO/IEC sections
   - Study mathematical definitions
   - Review academic papers
   - NO reference code viewing
   ```

2. **Design Phase**
   ```
   - Create algorithm flowchart
   - Define data structures
   - Design API interface
   - Document approach
   ```

3. **Implementation Phase**
   ```
   - Write code from scratch
   - Follow Rust best practices
   - Add comprehensive comments
   - Include attribution to spec sections
   ```

4. **Validation Phase**
   ```
   - Unit tests from spec examples
   - Integration tests
   - Compliance verification
   - Performance benchmarks
   ```

5. **Documentation Phase**
   ```
   - Update DERIVATIVE-TRACKING.md
   - Mark as ðŸŸ¢ Original
   - Document compliance with spec
   - Update licensing status
   ```

## Parallel Track Development

### Track A: Evaluation/Research (Current)
- Continue using existing derivative code
- For testing and development only
- Cannot be commercialized
- Located in `crates/` directory

### Track B: Commercial (New)
- Clean-room implementations only
- Can be fully commercialized
- Located in `commercial/` directory (to be created)
- Gradual migration from Track A

## Success Metrics

- [ ] All core algorithms implemented from spec
- [ ] Zero derivative code in commercial track
- [ ] Passing ISO/IEC 21122 compliance tests
- [ ] Performance within 20% of reference
- [ ] Full documentation of clean-room process

## Legal Checkpoints

Before commercialization, verify:
1. No code copied from reference
2. All algorithms from public specifications
3. Documentation trail of clean-room process
4. Legal review of implementation
5. Clear separation of tracks

## Timeline Summary

- **Weeks 1-4**: Core algorithms (DWT, Entropy)
- **Weeks 5-6**: Bitstream structure
- **Weeks 7-8**: Profiles and optimization
- **Week 9**: Legal review and documentation
- **Week 10**: Commercial release preparation

Total: 10 weeks to full commercial implementation

## Next Immediate Steps

1. Set up `commercial/` directory structure
2. Obtain ISO/IEC 21122 standards documents
3. Begin Week 1 DWT specification study
4. Create test vectors from spec examples
5. Start clean-room implementation log
