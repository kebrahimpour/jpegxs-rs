# CRITICAL COMMERCIALIZATION MEMO - LEGAL & BUSINESS FRAMEWORK

## üö® MANDATORY READING FOR BOTH REPOSITORIES

### **EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**
This memo documents the critical legal, business, and technical framework for commercializing the JPEG XS codec across both public and private repositories. **COMPLIANCE WITH THESE GUIDELINES IS MANDATORY** for legal protection and commercial success.

---

## ‚öñÔ∏è LEGAL FRAMEWORK - ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENTS

### **Clean-Room Implementation Protection**

#### **üîí NEVER MODIFY WITHOUT APPROVAL:**
```
CRITICAL LEGAL ASSETS:
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ commercial/jpegxs-core-clean/src/dwt.rs        # Clean-room DWT implementation
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ commercial/jpegxs-core-clean/src/lib.rs        # Clean-room codec core
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ commercial/README.md                           # Clean-room documentation
```

**Legal Protection Requirements:**
1. **Header Documentation**: Must always contain ISO specification references ONLY
2. **No Derivative Code**: Never copy from reference implementations
3. **Mathematical Basis**: All algorithms from published ISO equations only
4. **Evidence Trail**: Preserve development history showing clean-room process

#### **üõ°Ô∏è Clean-Room Header Template (MANDATORY)**
```rust
// Clean-room implementation from ISO/IEC 21122-1:2024 specification
// Source: [Specific ISO section and table references]
// Mathematical equations implemented from ISO specification ONLY - NO derivative code used
// Developer: Clean-room implementation
// Date: [Implementation date]
// Legal status: Original work based solely on ISO/IEC 21122-1:2024 mathematical equations
```

### **Patent Landscape Management**

#### **üö® CRITICAL PATENT DISCLAIMERS**
**ALWAYS Include in Commercial Documentation:**
```

## üî¨ RESEARCH FEATURES MANAGEMENT

### **ISO Compliance vs Research Extensions**

#### **üö® CRITICAL SEPARATION RULES**

**Public Repository (ISO Compliant ONLY):**
```rust
// EXAMPLE: Standard entropy coding implementation
pub fn add_entropy_coded_data(&mut self, coefficients: &[i32]) {
    // ISO-compliant implementation only
    // NO experimental features
    // NO bypass modes
}
```

**Private Repository (Research Extensions Allowed):**
```rust
// EXAMPLE: Research-enabled implementation
pub fn add_entropy_coded_data(&mut self, coefficients: &[i32]) {
    let bypass_entropy = std::env::var("JPEGXS_BYPASS_ENTROPY").is_ok();

    if bypass_entropy {
        // Research mode: violates standard for analysis
    } else {
        // Standard compliant mode
    }
}
```

#### **Research Feature Categories**

**Type 1: Algorithm Analysis (Private Only)**
```bash
JPEGXS_BYPASS_ENTROPY=1    # Skip standard entropy coding
JPEGXS_DEBUG_COEFFS=1      # Detailed coefficient logging
JPEGXS_RESEARCH_MODE=1     # Enable all research features
```

**Type 2: Performance Optimizations (Commercial Value)**
- 8-bit coefficient pipeline
- SIMD vectorization
- Multi-threaded processing
- Custom memory management

**Type 3: Standards Violations (Private + Documentation Required)**
- Extended run-length encoding beyond ISO specification
- Custom quantization methods
- Experimental compression techniques
