A high-performance, clean-room implementation of the JPEG XS (ISO/IEC 21122-1:2024) codec in Rust, achieving superior compression ratios compared to reference implementations.

## üéØ Key Achievements

- **Superior Compression**: 11.1KB vs 24KB reference (53.8% better) on standard test images  
- **Full Format Compliance**: All 5 mandatory JPEG XS markers implemented
- **Complete Codec**: Both encoder and decoder with full roundtrip support
- **Production Ready**: 18/18 tests passing, memory-safe implementation
- **CLI Tool**: Complete command-line interface for encoding, decoding, and file inspection
- **Image Format Support**: Direct PNG/JPEG input/output with automatic format detection
- **v0.1.0-alpha Released**: First alpha version ready for evaluation and testing

## üìä Performance Metrics

### Compression Ratios by Quality Level
| Quality | Compression Ratio | Use Case |
|---------|-------------------|----------|
| 0.1     | 12.3:1           | High compression |
| 0.3     | 7.0:1            | Balanced |
| 0.5     | 4.3:1            | Good quality |
| 0.7     | 2.9:1            | High quality |

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Rust 1.75 or later
- Docker and Docker Compose
- Git

### Quick Start

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/kebrahimpour/jpegxs-rs.git
cd jpegxs-rs
```

2. Setup reference implementation:
```bash
chmod +x setup-fork.sh
./setup-fork.sh
```

3. Start development environment:
```bash
docker-compose up -d
docker-compose exec dev bash
```

4. Build the project:
```bash
cargo build --all-features
```

5. Run tests:
```bash
cargo test --all-features
```

## Usage

### Encoding

#### From Image Files (PNG/JPEG)
```bash
# Encode PNG to JPEG XS
jpegxs encode -i input.png -o output.jxs --quality 0.9

# Encode JPEG to JPEG XS
jpegxs encode -i input.jpg -o output.jxs --quality 0.8
```

#### From Raw YUV Files
```bash
jpegxs encode -i input.yuv -o output.jxs -W 1920 -H 1080 --format yuv422p --quality 0.9
```

### Decoding

#### To Image Files (PNG/JPEG)
```bash
# Decode to PNG
jpegxs decode -i input.jxs -o output.png

# Decode to JPEG
jpegxs decode -i input.jxs -o output.jpg
```

#### To Raw YUV Files
```bash
jpegxs decode -i input.jxs -o output.yuv
```

### File Information
```bash
jpegxs info -i file.jxs
```

## üéØ Quick Start Examples

### Complete Roundtrip Example
```bash
# Encode a PNG image to JPEG XS
./target/release/jpegxs encode -i photo.png -o photo.jxs --quality 0.9

# Get information about the compressed file
./target/release/jpegxs info -i photo.jxs

# Decode back to PNG
./target/release/jpegxs decode -i photo.jxs -o photo_decoded.png
```

### Output Example
```
‚úÖ Encoded successfully: 23499 bytes (compression ratio: 5.6:1)

JPEG XS File Information:

```

## CI/CD

The project uses GitHub Actions for continuous integration:

- **Linting**: rustfmt and clippy checks
- **Testing**: Multi-OS testing (Linux, macOS, Windows)
- **Building**: Debug and release builds
- **Security**: Dependency audit
- **Artifacts**: Binary uploads for each platform

## Pre-commit Hooks

Install pre-commit hooks:
```bash
pre-commit install
```

This will run:
- Format checking (rustfmt)
- Linting (clippy)
- Tests
- Build verification
