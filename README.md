## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Rust 1.75 or later
- Docker and Docker Compose
- Git

### Quick Start

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kebrahimpour/jpegxs-rs.git
   cd jpegxs-rs
   ```

2. Setup reference implementation:
   ```bash
   chmod +x setup-fork.sh
   ./setup-fork.sh
   ```

3. Start development environment:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   docker-compose exec dev bash
   ```

4. Build the project:
   ```bash
   cargo build --all-features
   ```

5. Run tests:
   ```bash
   cargo test --all-features
   ```

## Usage

### Encoding

#### From Image Files (PNG/JPEG)

```bash
# Encode PNG to JPEG XS
jpegxs encode -i input.png -o output.jxs --quality 0.9

# Encode JPEG to JPEG XS
jpegxs encode -i input.jpg -o output.jxs --quality 0.8
```

#### From Raw YUV Files

```bash
jpegxs encode -i input.yuv -o output.jxs -W 1920 -H 1080 --format yuv422p --quality 0.9
```

### Decoding

#### To Image Files (PNG/JPEG)

```bash
# Decode to PNG
jpegxs decode -i input.jxs -o output.png

# Decode to JPEG
jpegxs decode -i input.jxs -o output.jpg
```

#### To Raw YUV Files

```bash
jpegxs decode -i input.jxs -o output.yuv
```

### File Information

```bash
jpegxs info -i file.jxs
```

### Quality Measurement (PSNR)

```bash
# Compare original and decoded images
jpegxs psnr -r original.png -t decoded.png
```

## 🎯 Quick Start Examples

### Complete Roundtrip Example

```bash
# Encode a PNG image to JPEG XS
./target/release/jpegxs encode -i photo.png -o photo.jxs --quality 0.9

# Get information about the compressed file
./target/release/jpegxs info -i photo.jxs

# Decode back to PNG
./target/release/jpegxs decode -i photo.jxs -o photo_decoded.png
```
