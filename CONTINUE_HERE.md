## 🎯 **EXACT CONTINUATION MESSAGE:**

```
Continue CI cost optimization setup for private repo. We need to properly implement the cost-saving workflow in the commercial repository only.
```

## 📋 **SESSION CONTEXT:**

### **✅ COMPLETED:**
- Emergency cleanup: Removed commercial code accidentally committed to public repo
- Public repo is clean with only basic ISO compliance tests
- Commercial test suite designed and ready for private repo
- GitHub token created: `jpegxs-ci-optimization` with `public_repo` scope

### **⏳ NEXT PRIORITIES:**
1. Set up CI optimization in PRIVATE repo (`kebrahimpour/jpegxs-rs-commercial`)
2. Add `PUBLIC_REPO_TOKEN` secret to private repo
3. Deploy commercial test suite to private repo only
4. Test cost optimization (70-80% savings expected)

### **🔑 KEY INFO:**
- **Public repo:** `kebrahimpour/jpegxs-rs` (clean, safe)
- **Private repo:** `kebrahimpour/jpegxs-rs-commercial` (needs setup)
- **Token name:** `jpegxs-ci-optimization`
- **Secret name:** `PUBLIC_REPO_TOKEN` (NOT `GITHUB_TOKEN`)
- **Working dir:** `/Users/keyvan/Work/Projects/sandbox/jpeg-xs`
- **Branch:** `feature/8bit-coefficients`

### **🚨 CRITICAL LESSON:**
**NEVER put commercial/private content in public repo again!**
CI optimization belongs ONLY in private repo.

**Status:** Ready to implement private repo CI optimization safely! 🚀
