# Session Summary & Next Steps

**Date**: 2025-09-13
**Session Focus**: Critical Quality Issues Investigation & Resolution
**Duration**: Multi-session spanning quality fixes, CI/CD setup, and PR review

## 🎯 Mission Accomplished

### Key Achievements This Session

#### 1. ✅ **Root Cause Analysis Complete**
- **Problem**: Encoder producing 6.6 dB PSNR (extremely poor quality)
- **Investigation**: Systematic conformance testing revealed fundamental issues
- **Findings**: DWT energy conservation failing (78.9% error), broken quantization parameter mapping

#### 2. ✅ **DWT 5/3 Implementation Fixed**
- **Issue**: Energy conservation failure, incorrect lifting scheme
- **Solution**: Implemented ISO/IEC 21122-1 compliant 5/3 DWT with perfect reconstruction
- **Result**: 0% energy error, < 1e-6 reconstruction precision
- **Validation**: Added comprehensive test suite with 8 validation tests

#### 3. ✅ **Quantization Parameter Mapping Corrected**
- **Issue**: Quality settings not translating to proper QP values
- **Root Cause**: Only passing 3 QP values instead of 13 subbands to WGT marker
- **Solution**: Fixed encoder to pass complete QP array from `compute_quantization_parameters()`
- **Result**: Quality 0.95 now correctly maps to QP=1 (virtually lossless)

#### 4. ✅ **Decoder QP Extraction Fixed**
- **Issue**: Decoder calling non-existent functions for QP extraction
- **Solution**: Implemented proper QP extraction using `decoder.get_qp_values()`
- **Result**: Decoder now uses exact QP values from bitstream WGT marker

#### 5. ✅ **Quality Improvement Achieved**
- **Before**: 6.6 dB PSNR (unacceptable)
- **After**: 8.3 dB PSNR (26% improvement)
- **Assessment**: Significant progress but still below 30+ dB target

#### 6. ✅ **CI/CD Pipeline Bulletproofed**
- **Problem**: GitHub CI failing on formatting/linting while local passed
- **Root Cause**: Different validation strictness (local: warnings allowed, CI: warnings=errors)
- **Solution**: Added comprehensive pre-commit hooks matching exact CI checks
- **Components Added**:
  - `cargo fmt --check` (strict formatting)
  - `cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings` (strict linting)
  - `cargo test --all-features` (comprehensive testing)
  - `cargo check --all-features` (compilation verification)
  - AI signature detection
  - File cleanup (whitespace, line endings)

#### 7. ✅ **PR #14 Successfully Merged**
- **Created**: Comprehensive PR with quality fixes and documentation
- **Review**: Addressed code review feedback (magic number → named constant)
- **Status**: Merged into main branch
- **Impact**: Foundation components now production-ready

#### 8. ✅ **Conformance Benchmarking Updated (NEW)**
- **Branch Updated**: Merged main branch improvements into feature/conformance-benchmarking

### 🔧 Remaining Critical Issue: Entropy Coding
**Root Cause Identified**: Aggressive multi-tier quantization in entropy coding system

```rust
// Problem code in jpegxs_core_clean::JpegXsBitstream::add_entropy_coded_data()
if abs_coeff <= 15 {
    let quantized = ((abs_coeff + 1) / 2).min(15) as u8;  // 2x quantization loss
} else if abs_coeff <= 127 {
    let quantized = (abs_coeff / 4).min(127) as u8;       // 4x quantization loss
} else {
    let quantized = (abs_coeff / 16).min(63) as u8;       // 16x quantization loss
}
```

**Impact**: Additional 2x-16x precision loss beyond DWT quantization, explaining poor quality
